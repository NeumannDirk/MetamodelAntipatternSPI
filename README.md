# MetamodelAntipatternSPI

This repository contains the software artifacts for the university course "Praktikum: Ingenieursmäßige Software-Entwicklung" at the KIT (Karlsruher Institut für Technologie". Goal is to implement a modular framework to analyse metamodels with respect to the prevalence of different metamodel antipatterns and at the same time asses different metrics to categorize metamodels and make findings more expressive. Another focus is on the parellelisation and overall speed of the evaluation of the metamodels.

## Technology for modularity 

Here, different technologies to achieve modularity are given together with some pros or cons to document the decisions made during the implementation.

## Attempts to improve performance

Here, different technologies to achieve higher performance are given together with some pros or cons to document the decisions made during the implementation.
